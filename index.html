            <p>hai, welcome to my little corner of the internet. im currently revamping this page at the moment so stuff might change from time to time</p>

            <fieldset>
                <legend class='title'><b>About</b></legend>
                <p>hai my name is Jack and im from the UK. im 18 and pretty into computers. i go by they/them :3</p>

                <p>im into almost anything involving computers. i tend to play games or code in my spare time but at the moment im just rotting. on my depression arc atm so its not great :c</p>

                <p>most of the stuff on the internet atm kinda sucks tbh so its cool that webrings are still around to use the web how it is meant to be used :3</p>

                <p>i made this page cus who wouldnt want to have a website? Not many ppl have their own websites now which kinda is sad since most sites today are corporate pages covered in ads</p>

                <p>there are still lots of ppl and with cool sites though and webrings tend to be a good place to find them. the webring im in has loads of sites here waaay better than this one <3</p>

                <p>im still mid way through changing this site to look cooler and a few pages are pretty empty so there will maybe be more here in the future so yeag :3</p>
